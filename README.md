### Hi there 👋

I am a computational biologist - originally trained as molecular biologist - who started learning data analysis in R in 2017. My current areas of expertise include **transcriptomics** (bulk and single cell), **translatomics**, **neurodevelopmental disorders**, **neurodegenerative diseases**, **genome editing**, and **stem cell biology**. I am particularly passionate about **data visualization**. 

Since early 2021 I started honing my skills as a package developer. So fare I have released seven R packages in the wild:

- 🧠 {[coldcuts](http://github.com/langleylab/coldcuts)} - draw and render neuroanatomical segmentations in 2D and 3D
- 🍳 {[oveRlay](http://github.com/gdagstn/oveRlay)} - annotate 2D scatterplots with overlay polygons
- 🎨 {[swatcheR](https://github.com/gdagstn/swatcheR)} - generate color swatches from pictures
- 🦜 {[alamak](https://github.com/gdagstn/alamak)} - let Pixel Pals handle your errors
- 🗺️ {[borges](https://github.com/gdagstn/borges)} - antique cartographic style 2D point clouds (UMAP, tSNE and the like)
- 🧫 {[cellula](https://github.com/gdagstn/cellula)} - pipeline with wrappers to many single cell RNA-seq analysis methods
- 🏢 {[HDB](https://github.com/langleylab/HDB)} - a geometric test to detect batch effects in single cell RNA-seq 

with hopefully more to come.

🛠 I am currently learning **three.js**, a little bit of **Python** on the side, and **Arduino** physical computing as a hobby.
